## Overview
Join us for a lab all about IBM Open Data Analytics for z/OS's two analytic stacks. 
Choose between Spark and the Scala programming language or Anaconda and the Python 
programming language. Choosing the Spark analytic stack, we will dive into z/OS data, 
such as SMF datasets, to investigate the data, visualize it, and finally grab various 
SMF operational insights. Choosing the Anaconda analytics stack, we will dive into 
Anaconda environments along with the various data analytics packages, as well as work 
in Python to dive into z/OS data to gather various insights. If you're able to complete 
one analytics stack, you may choose to continue onto the other, all within this one lab.
